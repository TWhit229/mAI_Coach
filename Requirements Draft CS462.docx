mAI Coach - Requirements 

1) Problem Statement & Scope (Team)  

Primary user: a gym-goer who wants real-time, actionable form feedback on compound lifts such as bench press while lifting alone. 

Secondary user: a coach or friend who reviews set summaries and flags for teaching or feedback. 

Context of use: the iPhone camera records a set; the app overlays a live skeleton, detects form issues (elbow flare/tuck, grip width, bar path), speaks feedback quickly after each rep, and counts reps. 

System boundaries: 

• In scope (v1): on-device pose tracking; steady overlay; rep counting; elbow/hand/bar-path checks; voice feedback; local storage. 

• Out of scope (v1): medical advice; cloud video storage by default; Android build. 

Measurable success criteria (initial): 

• Voice feedback median < 1.0 s from rep end; 95th percentile ≤ 1.5 s. 

• Elbow/hand/bar-path detectors achieve ≥95% sensitivity with ≤2.5% false-positive rate on held-out test clips. 

• Overlay jitter is capped by a numeric threshold; no obvious snaps/teleports during steady phases. 

• App remains crash-free during sets; crash-free rate target ≥99.5% in testing. 

• App can recover from crash (reboot time < 3s).  

Non-goal: this is not medical diagnosis or injury treatment. This is not professional lifting advice by a licensed trainer.  

 

2) Consolidated Requirements (Team) - PLACEHOLDER (to fill after merge) 

[Team will paste the merged, deduped list here with IDs REQ-001..n and AC for high-priority items. Do NOT duplicate Travis’s list below; merge first.] 

[PLACEHOLDER: Once we both finish, we can pput our team-agreed quality attributes here.] 

 

2.a) Travis - Personal Top-10 Requirements (Atomic, with AC & rationale) 

TW-REQ-001 - Elbow Position Detection Accuracy 

Category: Functional    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall detect reps where elbows are too far OUT or too far IN with ≥95% sensitivity and ≤2.5% false-positive rate. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Dataset: ≥200 labeled reps; ≥40% positives (out/in). Independent labels by 2 raters with tie-break. 

• Metric: On a held-out test split, sensitivity ≥95% for out/in; false-positive rate ≤2.5% on normal reps. 

• Angles: Thresholds (in degrees relative to torso) are defined and frozen prior to testing. 

• Test device: iPhone 14 Pro or newer; 1080p@30 fps; typical indoor lighting. 

Rationale:  

High-impact safety/performance error on bench; must be reliable. 

 

TW-REQ-002 - Hand Placement (Grip Width) Detection Accuracy 

Category: Functional    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall detect incorrect hand placement (too wide or too narrow) with ≥95% sensitivity and ≤2.5% false-positive rate. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Dataset: ≥200 labeled reps with classes narrow/normal/wide. 

• Metric: On held-out set, sensitivity ≥95% for narrow and for wide; FP ≤2.5% on normal. 

• Rule: Define grip width as a multiple of shoulder width or bar ring landmarks; freeze rule before testing. 

Rationale:  

Grip width affects shoulder stress and bar control; users expect clear feedback. 

 

TW-REQ-003 - Bar Path Detection Accuracy 

Category: Functional    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall detect improper bar path (e.g., excessive lateral drift or non-optimal vertical path) with ≥95% sensitivity and ≤2.5% false-positive rate. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Dataset: ≥200 labeled reps with 'ok' vs 'drift' examples across weights. 

• Metric: On held-out set, sensitivity ≥95% for drift; FP ≤2.5% on 'ok' reps. 

• Path corridor: Define acceptable lateral deviation corridor (e.g., ≤X cm normalized by shoulder width) prior to testing. 

Rationale:  

Bar path consistency strongly affects both safety and performance; core coaching cue. 

 

TW-REQ-004 - Steady Skeleton Overlay (Low Jitter) 

Category: Non-Functional (Quality)    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall render a steady skeleton overlay with no significant jitters or jumps during a set. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Metric: 95th-percentile per-joint frame-to-frame displacement ≤ 5 px at 1080p; no tracking dropouts >3 consecutive frames. 

• Visual QA: No obvious skeleton snaps when the lifter is steady. 

Rationale:  

A jumpy overlay is distracting and undermines trust in feedback. 

 

TW-REQ-005 - Voice Feedback Latency 

Category: Non-Functional (Performance)    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall provide voice feedback within <1.0 second of a completed rep (median). 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Metric: Start of audible feedback <1.0 s median and ≤1.5 s at 95th percentile from rep-end event. 

• Test: 50 reps across 5 sets on iPhone 14 Pro+ with device logs + audio capture. 

Rationale:  

Delayed audio breaks the coaching feel; sub-second feedback keeps it useful. 

 

TW-REQ-006 - Platform Minimums 

Category: Constraint / Non-Functional    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall run on iOS 17+ and iPhone 14 or newer with pose inference ≥15 fps at 1080p/30. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Metric: Median inference ≥15 fps during a 60 s capture; ≤1 dropped second. 

• Permissions: Camera access requested only when capturing; normal launch without camera works. 

Rationale:  

Set a realistic baseline device target and OS for performance and support. 

 

TW-REQ-007 - Rep Counting Accuracy 

Category: Functional    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall count bench press reps within ±1 rep error on ≥95% of sets. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Test: ≥30 labeled sets from ≥5 lifters. 

• Metric: |app_count − truth| ≤ 1 on ≥95% of sets. 

Rationale:  

Users need trustworthy counts even if they ignore all other cues. 

TW-REQ-008 - On-Device Processing (No Cloud Upload by Default) 

Category: Non-Functional (Privacy)    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall process on-device and shall not upload raw video or pose landmarks to the cloud by default. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Network capture during capture/review shows 0 B sent (excluding OS checks). 

• Any analytics, if later added, is opt-in and excludes raw media/landmarks. 

Rationale:  

Workout video is sensitive; local-by-default builds trust. 

TW-REQ-009 - Reliable Tracking at ~2 ft from Bench 

Category: Non-Functional (Robustness)    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall reliably detect/track form when the camera is ~2 ft (±6 in) from the bench at a standard side-angle preset. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Pose validity present in ≥90% of frames over a 60 s set under indoor lighting. 

• MUST items (TW-REQ-001/002/003/007) still meet their accuracy specs under this placement. 

Rationale:  

Users often place the phone close to the rack/bench; tracking must still hold. 

TW-REQ-010 - Application Stability (No Crashes) 

Category: Non-Functional (Reliability)    Priority: MUST 

Requirement:  

The system shall not crash during capture or review of a workout set. 

Acceptance Criteria (AC):  

• Metric: Crash-free session rate ≥99.5% across ≥200 sets in internal testing (e.g., TestFlight). 

• Auto-recovery: If a crash occurs, the last set summary appears as 'Recovered' on next launch. 

Rationale:  

Crashes during sets ruin the experience and can lose data. 

CS-REQ-011 – Feedback Voice Clarity 

Category: Non-functional (Usability).    Priority: SHOULD 

Requirement:  

The voice feedback must be intelligible above typical background gym noise levels (~70db). 

Acceptance Criteria (AC): 

In lab playback test, > 90% of words recognized by team members and stakeholders.  

Rationale: 

Ensures voice cues are still usable in realistic environments.  

CS-REQ-012 – Lighting Robustness 

Category: Non-functional (robustness).    Priority: SHOULD 

Requirement: 

The system shall remain > 90% tracking confidence in a standard indoor gym with default lighting (~300-600lux) with moving shadows and various colored background.  

Acceptance Criteria (AC): 

In test clips under various lighting, > 90% frames keep valid pose detection. 

Rationale: 

Gym lighting is inconsistent. Reliable tracking across different conditions prevents false alerts or wrong pose.  

CS-REQ-013 – User Privacy Confirmation Screen/Modal 

Category: Non-functional.    Priority: MUST 

Requirement: 

Within first launching the app from download, the app displays a privacy notice confirming the use of on-device processing and local storage use.  

Acceptance Criteria: 

Privacy screen appears once at first use and logs the user’s acceptance/denial. 

Rationale: 

Reinforces the user’s trust and aligns with Travis’s requirement #008.:  

 

3) Prioritization Method & Results (Team) - PLACEHOLDER 

[Team will choose a named method (MoSCoW/RICE/WSJF) and apply it to the CONSOLIDATED list.] 

[Include a small table with IDs, priority tags/scores, and note key dependencies.] 

 

4) Ethics, Risks, and Constraints Traceability 

Legal/ethical/privacy constraints: 

• Privacy by default (no cloud upload) -> TW-REQ-008. 

• Platform/licensing: document frameworks/models used (to be added after consolidation). 

Top risks (with mitigation/acceptance): 

• Model accuracy variance -> collect diverse test clips; freeze thresholds pre-test; calibrate camera placement. 

• Latency/thermal trade-offs -> maintain ≥15 fps; use lightweight smoothing; monitor thermal state. 

• Over-reliance on cues -> disclaimers; position as guidance, not medical advice. 

 

5) Merge Methodology & Change References - PLACEHOLDER 

[To do after both top-10] 

Commits: 

• Travis Whitney - paste 

• Cole Seifert – paste
